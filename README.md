# SecondPersonShooter
A Second Person Shooter Made for Scrapyard Hackathon

To Run You'll need to download the rbxl file, open it in studio, save to roblox, open a team create, and then add whomever you wanna play with to said team create, then just team test with them
...its not a public game because we did *not* have time to make sure that worked...
